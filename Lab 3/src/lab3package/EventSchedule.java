 * File name: EventSchedule.java

 * Course: CST8284 â€“ Java
 * Assignment: Lab 03
 * Due Date: 10 Feb 2023
 * Professor: David Houtman
 * Description: This class shows Overloaded constructor calls and linear constructor chaining using keyword 'this'. It allows user to 
 * to construct an event schedule object with different amount of parameters.In this code, the simpler constructors all call the
 * more complex one, from the no-arg constructor to the 4-arg constructor,
 * thereby chaining the calls 'UPWARDS'.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Part B: The benefit of linear constructor chaining provides flexibility for
 * user to create object with varying amount of data (parameters/properties). It
 * can be used to reuse code, reduce code duplication by creating separate
 * constructors for performing each task and building chain among them, as a
 * result enhancing the readability and maintainability of code. The chain of
 * constructors makes it easy to maintain and modify the code when new
 * properties or parameters are added or default values are changed, as one
 * constructor is changed, the chain will follow the flow. When calling a more
 * complex constructor from another simpler constructor, default values are set,
 * it ensure the objects are created in a correct, consistent and controlled
 * state.
 * </P>
 * <p>
 * If chained each class directly to the new 'base constructor', it is
 * complicated to add a new property to the EventSchedule class, since each of
 * the constructor need to be modify for adding a new property, it causes code
 * duplication and the constructor signature in each of the constructor more
 * complex. This could be prone to errors, such as forget to add the new
 * property or initialize the new property in one of the constructors, as well
 * as the entered parameter might not pass to the constructor properly, which
 * makes the objects created in a inconsistent and uncontrolled state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A non-linear chain is difficult to updated when new features are added to
 * class, since each of the constructor need to be updated with new features,
 * there is no interconnection between each constructor, except the connection
 * to the base constructor. Each constructor may become more complicated as more
 * new features added to the class, making the code difficult to maintain and
 * modify. On the other hand, if the new features requires a specific value to
 * be set during initialization, all the existing object instance in driver
 * class need to be updated to pass this value to the constructor, which is
 * time-consuming and could result in errors if not all instances are updated.
 * As result of these difficulties, it is difficult to update the code for
 * adding new features to a class with non-linear constructor chain.
