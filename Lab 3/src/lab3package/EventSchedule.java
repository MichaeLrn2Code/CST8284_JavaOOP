/**
 * This program depicts Overloaded constructor calls.
 * It shows the chaining of overloaded constructors using "this" keyword.
 * This lab has been completed for demo by: Wai Wai Chan.
 */

/**
 * This class is named EventSchedule Class. It shows constructor chaining using keyword "this".
 * In this code, the simpler constructors all call the more complex one, thereby
 * chaining the calls 'UPWARDS' (from the default constructor to the one 
 * with the most arguments. Ensure that you implement it in this order). 
 
 * EventSchedule() calls EventSchedule(int, int, int), program flow returns to
 * EventSchedule() and exits the constructor.
 * 
 * EventSchedule(int) calls EventSchedule(int, int, int), program flow returns
 * to EventSchedule(int) and exits the constructor.
 * 
 * EventSchedule(int, int) calls EventSchedule(int, int, int), program flow
 * returns to EventSchedule(int, int) and exits the constructor.
 * 
 * EventSchedule(int, int, int) just assigns the values.
